      <h4>About</h4>
       <p class="p1">Hello! My name is brody. I am a 23 year old aspiring developer. I currently have minimal experience in the dev world. I am currently going through a boot camp by Trilogy and SMU. We just finished week one. My background before My adventure to become a developer was very far from it. I come from farming. I was born and raised on a farm in oregon. At about age 14 I left home and started traveling the western half of the united states. I have met many people during my travels and experienced a lot for my age at the time. A family I grew close with got me involed with real-estate investing. We would buy homes, remodel them, and then sell them. I assumed the role of general contractor and was the lead contractor on the fix and flips. After a few years of this, I decided I wanted to take a new career path and experience something new and challenging. This portfolio will be updated and improved as I improve.</p>
